    "Since the last digit of $1000$ is $0$, that means there are 5 total numbers being added together (because $5 \\cdot 8 = 40$ which ends in a $0$). Then you need to find out how many $8$'s you need plus 4 (because of the 40), and that will get you to two 8's. Then I just guess-checked and adjusted and got $8+8+8+88+888= 1000$\n",

    "First, you can easily find out what $A$ is because you can add two 3-digit numbers and the answer has a number greater than 1 in the thousands place. And since you have to carry over a one in this problem, the only answer for $B$ would be $9$. So the final answer is $111+999=1110$\n",
