**Problem 172**: $2$ and $-1$ 


**Problem 173**: $-9$


**Problem 174**: It's just the sequence 1, 2, 3 $\cdots$ but without the one, so the 1000th term for 1, 2, 3, $\cdots$ would be 1000, but since the 1 isn't there then you would just add one, so it would be $1001$


**Problem 175**: Since the difference between each number is $2$, I just multiplied 1000 by 2, which I ended up getting $2000$.


**Problem 176**: It's the same sequence as the last one but the term is one less than the one above, so it would be $2000-1$, which would be $1999$


**Problem 177**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 178**：Yes, we do get a arithmetic progression. The difference is $-d$.


**Problem 179**: Yes, the difference is $2d$


**Problem 180**: No, because the difference between each number will be differet.


**Problem 181**: So you just need to find in between 5 and 8 and that number should have the same distance from 5 and 8, so the only number that follows that condition is $6.5$


**Problem 182**: You just need to find the averge between $a$ and $b$, so you do $\frac{a+b}{2}$.


**Problem 183**: To solve this problem I first found the gap between each number, which is $\frac{b-a}{3}$, and using that you just minus that from $b$ and add that to $a$ to find the two numbers in between. So the answer is $a+\frac{b-a}{3}$ and $b-\frac{b-a}{3}$.


**Problem 184**: So to find the total terms, you do the biggest number minus the smallest number, then divide that by the gap, then add one to it. So you would do $\frac{999-1}{2}+1 = \frac{998}{2}+1 = 499+1 = 500$ terms. 


**Problem 185**: To find the total amount of terms, you use the number from the question above, which is $500$ terms and compute. You do the biggest plus the smallest, and then you multiply that by the total terms divide by $2$. So if you plug those numbers in you get $(999+1)(500\div 2) = 1000 \cdot 250 = 250,000$.


**Problem 186**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 187**: Answer in the book.


**Problem 188**: To do thing problem, I used the formula to solve an arithmetic progression, which is $S=\frac{n(a+b)}{2}$, then using the terms from the problem I filled them in. You know that the first term is $1$ but you don't know what the last term is. So to find the last term you do $2n-1$, and $n$ is the total amount of terms. So you get $\frac{n(1+2n-1)}{2} = \frac{n+2n^2-n}{2} = \frac{2n^2}{2} = n^2$. 


**Problem 189**: $2$ and $\frac{1}{3}$


**Problem 190**：$4\frac{1}{2}$


**Problem 191**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 192**: The $nth$ term would equal to $a\cdot q^{n-1}$


**Problem 193**: Answer in the book.


**Problem 194**：If it takes one bacteria to full a vessel in 30 minutes, that means in 29 minutes it would have filled exactly half of the vessel, so that means if you have two bacteria then it would take one less minute to fill the vessel, so the answer would be $29$ minutes.


**Problem 195**: Answer in the book. 


**Problem 196**: Yes, it would be $q^2$ since the second it gone. 


**Problem 197**: No, because the difference between each number would be different.


**Problem 198**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 199**: Answer in the book. 


**Problem 200**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 201**: 
* $1+\frac{1}{2} = 1\frac{1}{2}$
* $1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4} = 1\frac{3}{4}$
* $1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8} = 1\frac{7}{8}$
* $1+\frac{1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1024}$, you can see a pattern, that it's $1+\frac{1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}=1\frac{n-1}{n}$, so for this problem it would be $1\frac{1023}{1024}$




**Problem 202**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 203**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 204**: Yes, if the progression is $\frac{1}{30}$.


**Problem 205**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 206**：Since positive geometric progression keeps larger or smaller, the only order is $2,3,5$ or $5,3,2$. The first case is proved and the second case is proved similarly by taking $q$ as $\frac{1}{q}$ as in the proof in the book.  


**Problem 207**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 208**:  Solution in the book.


**Problem 209**: No, because the difference of the progression will be positive and negative at the same time.


**Problem 210**: Solution in the book.


**Problem 211**: Yes, if you start with $0$ and keep adding $\sqrt{2}$'s to it, you get $0$, $\sqrt{2}$, $2\sqrt{2}$, $\cdots$. And $0$ is the only integer term.


**Problem 212**: Answer in the book. 


**Problem 213**: To find the $n$th term, you do $2^n-1$, so to find the one hundredth term you would plug that in to get $2^{100}-1$


**Problem 214**: We have $aq^n=aq^{n-1}+aq^{n-2}$ for all $n$. Let us assume $a\ne 0$, otherwise it is the trivial zero sequence. So we have 

$$q^{n-2}(q^2-q-1)=0.$$

Again we may assume $q\ne 0$. Then we can solve quadratic equation and get the golden ratio solutions in the book.  

**Problem 215**: Assume that $n=1$, then it would be 
$$a(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})+b(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})=1$$
And then you do $n=2$, which gets you:
$$a(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^2+b(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^2=1$$
$$=a(\frac{1^2+2\sqrt{5}+5}{4})+b(\frac{1^2-2\sqrt{5}+5}{4}) = 1 $$
$$=a(\frac{6+2\sqrt{5}}{4})+b(\frac{6-2\sqrt{5}}{4}) = 1$$
$$=a(\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2})+b(\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}) = 1$$

Then you subtract the equation when $n=2$ by the equaltion when $n=1$, which you get $a+b=0$. And from that $a$ must be equal to $-b$ so if you replace $a$ with $-b$ you get:

$$-b(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})+b(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})=1$$
$$=b(-1\cdot\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}+\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})=1$$
$$=b(\frac{-1-\sqrt{5}}{2}+\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})=1$$
$$=b(\frac{-1-\sqrt{5}+1-\sqrt{5}}{2})=1$$
$$=b(\frac{-2\sqrt{5}}{2})=1$$
$$=b(-\sqrt{5})=1$$
$$=-b\sqrt{5}=1$$
$$=b=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$$

From that you get $b$ but you still need $a$, but remember that $a=-b$, so that means $a=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$. So $a=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $b=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$




**Problem 216**: Solution in the book. 


**Problem 217**: So since an octave is $2$, I can just minus a major third and minor third from that to get the major and minor sixths. So for the minor sixth it would be $2/\frac{5}{4} = \frac{8}{5}$ and for a major sixth it would be $2/\frac{6}{5} = \frac{12}{5}$


**Problem 218**：Skip


**Problem 219**: Because it is geometric progression. The ratio of each transpose is always the same. 


**Problem 220**：If you change it to $q=\sqrt[7]{\frac{3}{2}}$ instead of the regular $q=\sqrt[12]{2}$. This is impossible.  


**Problem 221**: Listen to it.


**Problem 222**: Yes. Using the prove in the book it is correct.
