**Problem 39**: 
If you change $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{7}$ to have the same denominator, you have 21 as the denominator. So you change $\frac{1}{3}$ to 21ths and you get $\frac{7}{21}$. And you change $\frac{2}{7}$ into $\frac{6}{21}$. So $\frac{1}{3}$ is greater.

**Problem 40**: 
So since they are both really close to one, we just have to see which one is closer to 1 to see which one is bigger. So $\frac{10001}{10002}$ is $\frac{1}{10002}$ away from 1 and $\frac{100001}{100002}$ is only $\frac{1}{100002}$ away from 1. So that means $\frac{100001}{100002}$ is greater.

**Problem 41**: 

$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{a(b+1)}{b(b+1)}$ and $\frac{a+1}{b+1}=\frac{b(a+1)}{b(b+1)}$. So it depends on $a$ greater than $b$ or not. So $\frac{12345}{54321}$ is smaller.

**Problem 42**: 
(a) If $\frac{a}{b}$ can be simplified, that means $a=ka'$ and $b=kb'$. Now the difference to $\frac{c}{d}$ becomes $\frac{k(a'd-b'c)}{bd}$. So the numerator can not be $\pm 1$. So $\frac{a}{b}$ cannot be simplified. Same argument applies to $\frac{c}{d}$

(b) There is a typo in the book. The new fraction should be $\frac{a+c}{b+d}$. We may assume $\frac{a}{b}<\frac{c}{d}$. Now we have 

$$\frac{a+c}{b+d}-\frac{a}{b}=\frac{ab+cb-ab-ad}{b(b+d)}=\frac{cb-ad}{b(b+d)}$$

This implies $\frac{a+c}{b+d}>\frac{a}{b}$ and they are neighbor fractions. Same argument works for $\frac{a+c}{b+d}<\frac{c}{d}$.

(c) If $\frac{e}{f}$ is another neighbor fraction, let us assume that $\frac{a}{b}<\frac{e}{f}<\frac{c}{d}$. Then 
$eb-fa=1$ and $cf-ed=1$ so we get $$e(b+d)=f(a+c).$$ In other words, $\frac{e}{f}$ is the same as $\frac{a+c}{b+d}$ after simplification. But $\frac{a+c}{b+d}$ cannot be simplified because it is a neighbor fraction. So $f$ cannot be smaller than $b+d$.

**Problem 43**: 
So you can find that the same color pieces cannot appear twice in a segment (because $\frac{1}{7}$ and $\frac{1}{13}$ are both greater than $\frac{1}{20}$) and using the formula in the book, there will always be $\frac{k+l}{20}$ between each red and green mark. So each segment has exactly a red or green line on it.


**Problem 44**: 
It the same thing. Its just $\frac{7}{100} \cdot 5 \cdot 10^9$ and $\frac{5}{100} \cdot 7 \cdot 10^9$


**Problem 45**: 
So $\frac{3}{4}$ of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, so you need to cut off one fourth of the string.    

**Problem 46**: 
* $2^{10}= 1024$
* $10^3=1000$
* $10^7=10000000$

**Problem 47**: 
So $10^n$ is equal to 1000... with $n$ 0's so $10^{1000}$ would just equal 1000... with 1000 0's.

**Problem 48**: 
So there are $31,536,000$ seconds in one year. So multiply that by 4 and you get $126144000$. Then multiply that by $3\cdot 10^5$ and you get $37,843,200,000,000$ km.

**Problem 49**: 
Using the formula in the book, $2^{20} = 10^{20\cdot 0.3}= 10^6$ which is 6 decimal places.

**Problem 50**: 
* $10^{-1} = \frac{1}{10}$
* $10^{-2} = \frac{1}{100}$
* $10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000}$

**Problem 51**: 
Yes. If it's $n=0$ then it's $a^{-0} = \frac{1}{a^0} = 1 = a^0$. And if its negative for example $n=-3, a^{-(-3)} = \frac{1}{a^{-3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{a^3}} = a^3$, so for negative numbers it works.

**Problem 52**: 
* $a^{10}b^4$
* $2a^3 b^{-2}$

**Problem 53**: 
* $\frac{a^3}{b^5}$
* $\frac{1}{a^2b^7}$ 

**Problem 54**: 
No. If you put negative numbers in there it doesn't work anymore.

**Problem 55**: 
* $2000 - 1001 = 999$
* $n=-1003$
* $10^{-3} = \frac{1}{1000}, 2^{-10} = \frac{1}{1024}$. So $10^{-3}$ is bigger.
* $n=499$
* $n=1004$
* $n=200$
* $a=6$
* $n=150$

**Problem 56**: 
$a=-3$, $b=2$, and $n=2$. $((-3)2)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36 = 9 \cdot 4 = (-3)^2 \cdot 2^2$

**Problem 57**: 
For positive $n$: For example, $a=2$, $b=3$, $n=3$, $(2\cdot3)^3 = 6^3 = 216 = 8\cdot 27 = 2^3\cdot 3^3$. For negative $n$: $n=-3$: $(2\cdot 3)^{-3} = 6^{-3} = \frac{1}{216} = \frac{1}{8}\cdot \frac{1}{27} = 2^{-3} \cdot 3^{-3}$.

**Problem 58**: 
$(-a)^{775}=-(a^{775})$ because 775 is an odd number so there are an odd amount of $a$'s so all of them cancel out except one $-a$.

**Problem 59**: 
$(\frac{a}{b})^n = (a\div b)^n = (a\cdot \frac{1}{b})^n = a^n \cdot (\frac{1}{b})^n = a^n \cdot \frac{1}{b^n} = a^n \div b^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$.

**Problem 60**:
* $4^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{4} = 2$
* $27^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3$

**Problem 61**: 
* $101^2 = (100+1)^2 = 10000 + 1 + 200 = 10201$
* $1001^2 = (1000+1)^2 = 1000000 + 1 + 2000 = 1002001$


**Problem 62**: 
$ab=n$, $\frac{11}{10}a \cdot \frac{11}{10}b = (\frac{11}{10})^2 ab = 1.21ab = 1.21n$. So it increased the product by $21$%.

**Problem 63**: 
No. A father can have multiple sons.

**Problem 64**: 
Solution in the book, the final answer for $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$

**Problem 65**: 
* $99^2 = (100-1)^2 = 10000 - 200+1 = 9801$
* $998^2 = (1000-2)^2 = 1000000 - 4000 + 4 = 996004$ 

**Problem 66**: 
* $a=b$: $(a+b)^2 = (a+a)^2= (2a)^2 = 2a \cdot 2a = 4a^2$
* $a=2b$: $(a+b)^2 = (2b+b)^2 = (3b)^2 = 9b^2$
