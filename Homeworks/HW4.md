**Problem 223**: So using Vieta's formula, you find the $p=-2$ and $q=-1$, so using that you can factor $x^2-3x+2=0$ to $(x-2)(x-1)=0$. Now since zero times anything is zero, you know that either $x-2$ or $x-1$ must equal zero, so the answer will be $1$ and $2$.


**Problem 224**: 
* $x^2-4=0$, 
$x^2=4$, $x=\pm2$
* $x^2+2=0$, $x^2=-2$, $x=\sqrt{-2}$, so $x$ has no solution.
* $x^2-2x+1 = 0$, $p=-2$ and $q=1$, so $(x-1)^2 = 0$, $x=1$
* $x^2-2x+1=9$, $x^2-2x-8=0$,  $(x-4)(x+2)=0$, $x=4$ or $-2$
* $x^2-2x-8=0$, $(x-4)(x+2)=0$, $x=4$ or $-2$
* $x^2-2x-3=0$, $(x+1)(x-3)=0$, $x=-1$ or $3$

* $x^2-5x+6=0$, $(x-2)(x-3)=0$, $x=2$ or $3$

* $x^2-x-2 = 0$, $x^2-1x-2=0$, $(x+1)(x-2)=0$, $x=-1$ or $2$


**Problem 225**: If $b=0$, then $c=0$


**Problem 226**: Solution in book. 


**Problem 227**: Assume that $\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}$, and $a$ and $b$ are both intergers that do not have a common factor. Since all numbers follow either $3k$, $3k+1$, or $3k+2$, then you can test all the possiblilties. For example, if $\sqrt{3} = \frac{3k+1}{3l+1}$, then you can turn that into 

$$3(3l+1)^2 = (3k+1)^2$$

and from that you can see that the left hand part is divisible by $3$ and the right hand side isn't, so that doesn't work. And it also doesn't work if $a$ are either $3k+1$ or $3k+2$, because one side will be divisible by $3$ and the other side isn't divisible by $3$. So $a=3k$. 

Now the equation becomes 

$$3b^2=9k^2$$

or 

$$b^2=3k^2$$

By exactly the same reasoning, $b=3l$. Now you can see that $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{3k}{3l}$ 
has a common denominator of $3$. This is a contradiction to the fraction is reduced. So $\sqrt{3}$ cannot be a fraction, which is irrational. 



**Problem 228**: When $a$ and $b$ are greater or equal to 0 then this works: $(\sqrt{a}\cdot \sqrt{b})^2 = (\sqrt{a})^2\cdot (\sqrt{b})^2 = a\cdot b = (\sqrt{ab})^2$, if it is smaller than $0$ then this doesn't work. 


**Problem 229**: $\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \sqrt{ab^{-1}} = \sqrt{a}\cdot \sqrt{b^{-1}} = \sqrt{a}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$


**Problem 230**: No, if its negative then $\sqrt{a^2} = -a$. The correct equation is $\sqrt{a^2}=|a|$ (as stated in the book)


**Problem 231**: 
* $\frac{1}{2+\sqrt{3}} = 2-\sqrt{3}$ , $1=(2+\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3})$ , $1=2^2-(\sqrt{3}^2)$ , $1=4-3$
* $\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}-\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{7}}{2}$ , $1=\frac{(\sqrt{7}+\sqrt{5})(\sqrt{7}-\sqrt{5})}{2}$ , $1=\frac{(\sqrt{7})^2-(\sqrt{5})^2}{2}$ , $1=(7-5)\div 2$ , $1=1$


**Problem 232**: Since both numbers are positive then you can multiply both numbers by the same positive number and then compare the results. If you multiply $\sqrt{1001}+\sqrt{1000}$ to both sides, you get $(\sqrt{1001}-\sqrt{1000})(\sqrt{1001}+\sqrt{1000}) = 1001-1000 =1$ and you get $\frac{\sqrt{1001}+\sqrt{1000}}{10}$ on the other side. Then you multiply $10$ to both sides and you get $10$ and $\sqrt{1001}+\sqrt{1000}$. And since $10$ is smaller than $\sqrt{1001}+\sqrt{1000}$ so $\sqrt{1001}-\sqrt{1000}$ is smaller than $\frac{1}{10}$. 

**Problem 233**: Answer is in book.


**Problem 234**: Answer is in book, it says that and answer should be $\sqrt{2}-1$, not $1-\sqrt{2}$


**Problem 235**: $x^2+2x-6 = (x^2+2x+1)-7 = 0$ , $(x+1)^2-7 = 0$ , $(x+1)^2 = 7$ , $x+1=\pm\sqrt{7}$ , so $x=-1+\sqrt{7}$ or $-1-\sqrt{7}$


**Problem 236**: $x^2+2x-8=0$ , $(x+4)(x-2)=0$ , so $x=-4$ and $2$


**Problem 237**: $x^2+3x+1 = x^2+2\cdot 1.5x+(1.5)^2-(1.5)^2+1= (x+1.5)^2-2.25+1 = (x+1.5)^2-1.25$, So $(x+1.5)^2-1.25 = 0$ , $(x+1.5)^2 = 1.25$ , $x+1.5=\sqrt{1.25}$ , $x= -1.5\pm \sqrt{1.25}$


**Problem 238**: $x^2-2x+2=0$ , $(x-1)^2+1=0$ , $(x-1)^2 = -1$, so there are not possible answers unless you include complex numbers.


**Problem 239**: If $a=b$ then you have $(x+a)^2 = x^2+2ax+a^2$


**Problem 240**: $(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = ((x-a)(x-b))(x-c) = (x^2-(a+b)x+ab)(x-c) = x^3+(-a-b-c)x^2+(ab+bc+ac)x-abc$
