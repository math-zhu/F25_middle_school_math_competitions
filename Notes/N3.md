# Lecture 3: The Binomial Theorem $(a+b)^n$

## 1. Expanding $(a + b)^2$

Let's expand $(a + b)^2$ step by step:

$$(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)$$


Apply the distributive law (multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket):

$$= a(a + b) + b(a + b)= a \cdot a + a \cdot b + b \cdot a + b \cdot b$$

Apply the commutative law, we get 
$$(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

#### Visual (Picture) Proof

Imagine a square with side length $(a + b)$.  
The area of the square is $(a + b)^2$.

You can split the square into four smaller regions:

- A square of area $a^2$ (side $a$)
- A square of area $b^2$ (side $b$)
- Two rectangles of area $ab$ each

Here is a diagram:

```
+-----------------------+
|         |             |
|   a^2   |    ab       |   a
|         |             |
+-----------------------+
|         |             |
|   ab    |    b^2      |   b
|         |             |
+-----------------------+
      a         b
```

**Exercise** Find a geometric proof for $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$

## 2. Expanding $(a + b)^3$ and $(a + b)^4$

Now let's expand $(a + b)^3$:

$$(a + b)^3 = (a + b)(a + b)(a + b)$$

First, expand $(a + b)(a + b)$ as above:

$$(a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

Now multiply this result by $(a + b)$:

$$= (a + b)(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$$

Apply the distributive law again:

$$= a(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + b(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$$

$$= a^3 + 2a^2b + ab^2 + ba^2 + 2ab^2 + b^3$$

Now apply commutative and associative law, we get 

$$(a+b)^3= a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$$

**Exercise** Prove this geometrically.

### Expanding $(a + b)^4$
$$(a+b)^4= (a+b)(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)$$

$$=a^4+a^3b+3a^2b^2+ab^3+ba^3+2ba^2b+2bab^2+b^4$$

$$=a^4+4a^3b+6a^2b^2+4ab^3+b^4$$

## 3. Binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle

### Pascal's Triangle

Binomial coefficients can be found in **Pascal's Triangle**. Each row of the triangle gives the coefficients for $(a + b)^n$:

```
      1
     1 1
    1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
  1 4 6 4 1
```

- The $n$th row corresponds to the coefficients for $(a + b)^n$. The coefficients in front of each term are called **binomial coefficients**.
- For example, the coefficients for $(a + b)^3$ are $1, 3, 3, 1$.
- the most left and most right numbers are always one.

**Theorem:** Each number inside Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

**Why?** to get $a^2b$, we have two ways $a(ab)$ and $b\cdot a^2$. We have two copies of $ab$ and one copy of $a^2$ in previous expansion.

**Binomial Theorem Formula:**
$$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$$

This formula uses the coefficients from Pascal's Triangle for each term in the expansion.

**Definition:**  
The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ (read as "n choose k") is the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from $n$ objects, without regard to order. It is given by the formula:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

where $n!$ means $n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1$.

Another way to understand the binomial coefficient is by counting the number of ways to get $k$ heads when tossing $n$ coins.

Each coin can land as either Heads ($H$) or Tails ($T$), so the outcome of tossing one coin is $(H + T)$.  
For two coins, the possible outcomes are:
$$(H + T)(H + T) = HH + HT + TH + TT$$

- $HH$ (2 heads)
- $HT$ (1 head, 1 tail)
- $TH$ (1 head, 1 tail)
- $TT$ (0 heads)

If we look at the number of ways to get $k$ heads:
- 2 heads: $HH$ (1 way)
- 1 head: $HT$, $TH$ (2 ways)
- 0 heads: $TT$ (1 way)

These numbers ($1, 2, 1$) match the binomial coefficients for $(a + b)^2$.

For three coins:
$$(H + T)^3 = HHH + HHT + HTH + HTT + THH + THT + TTH + TTT$$

Count the number of ways to get $k$ heads:
- 3 heads: $HHH$ (1 way)
- 2 heads: $HHT$, $HTH$, $THH$ (3 ways)
- 1 head: $HTT$, $THT$, $TTH$ (3 ways)
- 0 heads: $TTT$ (1 way)

So, the numbers ($1, 3, 3, 1$) match the binomial coefficients for $(a + b)^3$.

**In general:**  
The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ counts the number of ways to get $k$ heads (and $n-k$ tails) when tossing $n$ coins. This is a practical example of combinations and shows how binomial coefficients appear in probability and counting problems.
