# Lecture 4: Solving Equations

## 1. Solving Equations in One Variable

### Types of Equations
We will use $x$ for the unknown variable and $a, b, c, \ldots$ as fixed numbers.

- **Linear equation:** $ax + b = 0$
- **Quadratic equation:** $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
- **Cubic equation:** $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$
- **Quartic (degree $4$), Quintic (degree $5$), Sextic (degree $6$):**
  $$
  a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0
  $$
  The left-hand side is called a **polynomial** of degree $n$. The solutions (roots of $p(x)$) are values $x_0$ such that $p(x_0) = 0$.

### Solving Linear Equations
For the equation $ax + b = 0$, consider two cases:
- If $a = 0$, the equation is solvable only when $b = 0$, and $x$ can be any number.
- If $a \ne 0$, then $x = -\frac{b}{a}$.

**Observation:** Every rational number is a solution of a linear equation, and every solution of a linear equation is a rational number.

### Solving Quadratic Equations
For the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, consider two cases:
- If $a = 0$, it reduces to a linear equation (see above). All solutions are rational.
- If $a \ne 0$, divide both sides by $a$:
  $$
  x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0
  $$
  Let $p = \frac{b}{a}$ and $q = \frac{c}{a}$, so the equation becomes:
  $$
  x^2 + p x + q = 0
  $$

### Easy and Difficult Example
For the equation $x^2 = 2$, the solution is $x = \pm\sqrt{2}$.

**Question:** Is $\sqrt{2}$ a rational number? (Recall: linear solutions are always rational.)

**First Crisis in Mathematics:**  
The ancient Greeks believed all numbers were rational because they were "rational"!

**Theorem:** $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.

**Proof:**  
Suppose $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ for integers $a, b$ with no common factors (in lowest terms).  
Then $\frac{a^2}{b^2} = 2$, so $a^2 = 2b^2$.

- $a$ must be even, so $a = 2k$.
- Substitute: $4k^2 = 2b^2 \implies 2k^2 = b^2$, so $b$ must also be even.
- But if both $a$ and $b$ are even, the fraction is not in lowest terms. **Contradiction!**

**Aftermath:**  
Legend says the Greeks could not accept this result, so they threw the mathematician who discovered it into the sea!

## 2. Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring and Vieta's Theorem

If the equation $x^2 + p x + q = 0$ can be factored as $(x - x_1)(x - x_2)$, then the roots are $x_1$ and $x_2$. For other values of $x$, the right-hand side is not zero.

**Examples:**
- $x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)(x + 1) = 0$ so $x = -1$
- $x(x - 2) = 0$ so $x = 0$ or $2$
- $x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0$ so $x = 1$ or $2$

**Problem:** Guessing the factorization can sometimes be difficult.

**Hero #1:** Vieta, Italian mathematician

**Vieta's Theorem:**  
If $x^2 + p x + q = (x - x_1)(x - x_2) = 0$, then
$$
p = -(x_1 + x_2)
$$
$$
q = x_1 x_2
$$

**Proof:**  
$(x - x_1)(x - x_2) = x^2 - (x_1 + x_2)x + x_1 x_2 = 0$

**Corollary:**  
To factor $x^2 + p x + q, find two numbers whose sum is $-p$ and whose product is $q$.

**Examples:**
- $x^2 - 2x - 3$: $-3$ as a product, $(-1) \times 3$ or $(-3) \times 1$, so $(x - 3)(x + 1)$
- $x^2 + 25x + 84$: $84 = 4 \times 21$, so $(x + 4)(x + 21)$
- $x^2 - 7x + 10$: $10 = 2 \times 5$, sum is $7$, so $(x - 2)(x - 5)$
- $x^2 - 9x + 9$: perfect square, $(x - 3)^2$
- $x^2 - 36$: difference of squares, $(x - 6)(x + 6)$

**Diophantine's Question (2000 years ago):**  
Find two numbers whose sum is $9$ and whose product is $20$.

$$
a + b = 9
$$
$$
ab = 20
$$

This is equivalent to solving $x^2 - 9x + 20 = 0$ by Vieta's theorem.

**Use algebra:**
$$(a + b)^2 - 4ab = (a - b)^2$$
So $a - b = \pm\sqrt{81 - 80} = \pm 1$.  
Since $a + b = 9$, the two numbers are $4$ and $5$.

**General Solution:**

$$
a + b = -p
$$
$$
ab = q
$$
So
$$
a - b = \pm\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}
$$
Therefore,
$$
a, b = \frac{-p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}}{2}
$$

**Rewrite for Standard Quadratic Equation:**

Plug in $p = \frac{b}{a}$ and $q = \frac{c}{a}$, so the solution is
$$
\frac{-\frac{b}{a} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 - \frac{4c}{a}}}{2}
= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
